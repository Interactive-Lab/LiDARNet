# LiDAR-Scanning-Outdoor-Object-Dataset-LSOOD-
This dataset is collected by an HDL-32E Velodyne LiDAR sensor carried by our UGV platform. Raw point clouds collected from a real outdoor scene are segmented into individual obstacles according to a fast spatial clustering method [1]. We developed a semi-automatic 3D object labeling tool to store individual object point clouds [2]. The UGV and a semi-automatic 3D object labeling tool are presented in the following figure.
